# nn-experiments

* nn_from_scratch: modular and matrix-based implementation of various deep learning architectures and associated techniques; this is not production-level code and mostly used for exercising and learning by me

* twitter: deep long-short term memory language model for training on very large twitter datasets (> RAM); easily applicable to arbitrary data
